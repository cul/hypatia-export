ac:128939,"","Epigenetic regulation of gene expression occurs due to alterations in chromatin proteins that do not change DNA sequence, but alter the chromatin architecture and the accessibility of genes, resulting in changes to gene expression that are preserved during cell division. Through this process genes are switched on or off in a more durable fashion than other transient mechanisms of gene regulation, such as transcription factors. Thus, epigenetics is central to cellular differentiation and stem cell linage commitment. One such mechanism is DNA methylation, which is associated with gene silencing and is involved in a cellâ€™s progression towards a specific fate. Mechanical signals are a crucial regulator of stem cell behavior and important in tissue differentiation; however, there has been no demonstration of a mechanism whereby mechanics can affect gene regulation at the epigenetic level. In this study, we identified candidate DNA methylation sites in the promoter regions of three osteogenic genes from bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We demonstrate that mechanical stimulation alters their epigenetic state by reducing DNA methylation and show an associated increase in expression. We contrast these results with biochemically induced differentiation and distinguish expression changes associated with durable epigenetic regulation from those likely to be due to transient changes in regulation. This is an important advance in stem cell mechanobiology as it is the first demonstration of a mechanism by which the mechanical micro-environment is able to induce epigenetic changes that control osteogenic cell fate, and that can be passed to daughter cells. This is a first step to understanding that will be vital to successful bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, where continued expression of a desired long-term phenotype is crucial.","","","","","","","",Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

ac:130066,"","Avian bornavirus (ABV) is a newly discovered member of the family Bornaviridae that has been associated with the development of a lethal neurologic syndrome in birds, termed proventricular dilatation disease (PDD). We successfully isolated and characterized ABV from the brains of 8 birds with confirmed PDD. One isolate was passed 6 times in duck embryo fibroblasts, and the infected cells were then injected intramuscularly into 2 healthy Patagonian conures (Cyanoliseus patagonis). Clinical PDD developed in both birds by 66 days postinfection. PDD was confirmed by necropsy and histopathologic examination. Reverse transcriptionâ€“PCR showed that the inoculated ABV was in the brains of the 2 infected birds. A control bird that received uninfected tissue culture cells remained healthy until it was euthanized at 77 days. Necropsy and histopathologic examinations showed no abnormalities; PCR did not indicate ABV in its brain tissues.",,,,,,,"","",,Articles,,,,10.3201/eid1603.091257,AC:P:9939,English,,"","",Reddy,Sanjay M.,author,"","",Tizard,Ian,author,,,,,,,,"","",,Gray,Patricia,author,,,,,,,,"","",,Hoppes,Sharman,author,,,,,,,,"","",,Suchodolski,Paulette,author,,,,,,,,"","",,Mirhosseini,Negin,author,,,,,,,,"","",,Payne,Susan,author,"","",Villanueva,Itamar,author,"","",,,,Shivaprasad,H.

ac:130062,"","To identify a candidate etiologic agent for turkey viral hepatitis, we analyzed samples from diseased turkey poults from 8 commercial flocks in California, USA, that were collected during 2008â€“2010. High-throughput pyrosequencing of RNA from livers of poults with turkey viral hepatitis (TVH) revealed picornavirus sequences. Subsequent cloning of the â‰ˆ9-kb genome showed an organization similar to that of picornaviruses with conservation of motifs within the P1, P2, and P3 genome regions, but also unique features, including a 1.2-kb sequence of unknown function at the junction of P1 and P2 regions. Real-time PCR confirmed viral RNA in liver, bile, intestine, serum, and cloacal swab specimens from diseased poults. Analysis of liver by in situ hybridization with viral probes and immunohistochemical testing of serum demonstrated viral nucleic acid and protein in livers of diseased poults. Molecular, anatomic, and immunologic evidence suggests that TVH is caused by a novel picornavirus, tentatively named turkey hepatitis virus.",,,,,,,"","",,Articles,,,,10.3201/eid1703.101410,AC:P:9938,English,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kh2358,Columbia University.
